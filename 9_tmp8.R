## Example data 
     jobdat <- matrix(c(
     				295	,20,	2,	2,	1,	5,	7,
     				45	,3309,	15,	1,	0,	0,	3,
     				23	,221,	2029,	5,	3,	0,	2,
     				3	,2,	10,	100,	8,	3,	3,
     				2	,2,	3,	8,	109,	4,	4,
     				10	,0,	0,	2,	4,	375,	38,
     				11	,18,	0,	3,	4,	26,	260
     	), nrow = 7, ncol = 7, byrow = TRUE,
                    dimnames = list(c("job 1","job 2","job 3","job 4","job 5","job 6","job 7"),
                                    c("job 1","job 2","job 3","job 4","job 5","job 6","job 7")))
view(jobdat)
 
hvis jeg gerne vil udvÃ¦lge job 1, 5 og 7:

jobdat2 <- jobdat[c(1,5,7),c(1,5,7)]

view(jobdat2)

There are two problems with this. The first is the most serious: I want to get all the 

the problem is, this only selects the cells that directly influences each other, whereas what I need is *all* the cells from the three job categories coincides. Since I don't know how to do it, here is a matrix constructed with the required result:


     jobdat <- matrix(c(
     				295	,20,	2,	2,	1,	5,	7,
     				45	,3309,	15,	1,	0,	0,	3,
     				23	,221,	2029,	5,	3,	0,	2,
     				3	,2,	10,	100,	8,	3,	3,
     				2	,2,	3,	8,	109,	4,	4,
     				10	,0,	0,	2,	4,	375,	38,
     				11	,18,	0,	3,	4,	26,	260
     	), nrow = 7, ncol = 7, byrow = TRUE,
                    dimnames = list(c("job 1","job 2","job 3","job 4","job 5","job 6","job 7"),
                                    c("job 1","job 2","job 3","job 4","job 5","job 6","job 7")))
