hvis jeg gerne vil udvÃ¦lge job 1, 5 og 7:

jobpick_wrong <- jobdat[c(1,5,7),c(1,5,7)]

view(jobpick)

There are two problems with this. The first is the most serious: I want to get all the 

the problem is, this only selects the cells that directly influences each other, whereas what I need is *all* the cells from the three job categories that coincides with each other, since that is the actual jobmobility. 

     Since I dont know how to do it, here is a matrix constructed with the required result:


     jobdat  <- matrix(c(
     				295	,20,	0,	0,	0,	5,	7,
     				45	,3309,	15,	0,	0,	0,	3,
     				23	,221,	2029,	5,	0,	0,	0,
     				3	,0,	10,	100,	8,	0,	3,
     				2	,0,	0,	0,	109,	4,	4,
     				10	,0,	0,	0,	4,	375,	38,
     				11	,18,	0,	0,	4,	26,	260
     	), nrow = 7, ncol = 7, byrow = TRUE,
                    dimnames = list(c("job 1","job 2","job 3","job 4","job 5","job 6","job 7"),
                                    c("job 1","job 2","job 3","job 4","job 5","job 6","job 7")))
view(jobdat)






ego(graph, order, nodes = V(graph), mode = c("all", "out", "in"), mindist = 0)


view(jobpick_right)


?neighborhood

wm <-  jobdat

library(igraph)

mode <- c("all")

net           <- graph.adjacency(jobdat, mode = "directed", weighted = TRUE)

neigh         <- ego(net, 1, mode = mode)


view(neigh)
